You need to add three icon files in this directory:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor. They should represent the auto-save functionality of the extension.

For a quick setup, you can use simple colored squares or find free icon resources online. Make sure to follow Chrome's extension icon guidelines.
